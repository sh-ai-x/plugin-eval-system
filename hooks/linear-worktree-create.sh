# linear-worktree-create.sh — PostToolUse:Bash hook.
#
# Catches a `git worktree add` after the Bash tool returns. The
# worktree-auto-cut.sh UserPromptSubmit hook covers the
# auto-cut case; this hook covers the manual case (e.g. the
# user runs `git worktree add -b feat/foo .worktrees/foo
# origin/main` themselves) so the new worktree's handoff gets
# registered before its first Edit|Write (or first SessionStart,
# if the user reopens Claude Code in the new path).
#
# The auto-sync is owner-gated inside tools/linear_sync.py::
# auto_sync — non-owners bail silently.
#
# Path resolution: prefer the path parsed out of the bash
# command (the only authoritative signal of "which worktree was
# just created"). Fall back to the most recent entry in `git
# worktree list --porcelain` if the parse fails (e.g. multi-line
# bash command, or an exotic flag the parser doesn't know).
#
# Always exits 0 (non-blocking per #539).

# Source the shared preamble (set -uo pipefail, INPUT=$(cat),
# worktree_detect, jq-missing warning).
# shellcheck source=lib/hook-preamble.sh
