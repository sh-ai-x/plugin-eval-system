# hooks/linear-autosync.sh — PreToolUse Edit|Write|MultiEdit hook.
#
# Calls tools/linear_sync.py so that every Claude Code edit is
# reflected in the user's Linear workspace without a manual
# `/dev-kit:linear` invocation. The Python script is the
# authoritative gate (config + non-blocking). This wrapper exists
# to:
#   1. Pull CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR from the hook payload.
#   2. Skip when Linear is clearly not configured across ANY of
#      the supported sources (env var, .env.linear, per-worktree
#      linear-config.json, legacy .enabled.json).
#   3. Always exit 0 (per #539: "Linear failures are non-blocking
#      for implicit workflow calls.").
#
# The fast-path is a deliberate micro-optimization. It MUST mirror
# every activation source the Python script supports; if the user
# configured Linear via user-scope `~/.config/dev-kit/.env` (Option B
# in the skill) or per-worktree `.dev-kit/.env.linear` (Option C), the
# gate is wide open and we still need to fork Python to read the key.
# Failing to check this is the single most common way auto-sync
# silently stops working.
