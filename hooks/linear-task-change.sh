# linear-task-change.sh — UserPromptSubmit hook.
#
# Detects plan / task changes mid-session and triggers one
# auto-sync round. The detection is delegated to
# tools/linear_sync.py::task_change_sync, which compares the
# current scope (branch + latest commit subject) against the
# last-recorded handoff scope. When the scopes match, the
# function bails without a Linear round-trip; when they differ,
# it delegates to auto_sync (which is itself owner-gated).
#
# This hook closes the gap where a session sits idle after a
# branch change or a fresh commit and the next Edit|Write is
# many minutes away — the user can now expect a Linear update
# immediately after stating the new intent, not after the next
# accidental save.
#
# The hook is intentionally narrow: it does NOT inject any
# additionalContext. The handoff is the source of truth, the
# Linear issue is just the user's view of it; adding a textual
# nudge would compete with the model's own handling of the
# task-change signal.
