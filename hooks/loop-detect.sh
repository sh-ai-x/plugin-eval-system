#
# Doom-loop detector (Pattern 1 from
# docs/proposals/playbook-application/02-reanalysis.yaml). After every
# Bash call, asks the sourced helper whether the last
# ${LOOP_DETECT_THRESHOLD:-3} entries in
# .dev-kit/hand-off/<session>.log are an identical tool + first-80-chars
# match. If yes, prints an advisory so the agent can break the cycle
# (vary input, switch tool, ask the user) before the next retry.
#
# Why this exists:
#   Doom loops silently burn ~5-10k tokens per session and never
#   recover on their own. A warn-on-third breaks the loop cheaply
#   without needing a process-level kill switch.
#
# Fail-open contract:
#   - Missing jq / payload / session id → exit 0 with no output
#     (doom-loop detection is advisory; we never block a tool that
#     already ran).
#   - Helper returns an unexpected rc != 0,1 → treat as no loop
#     (defensive: a future helper bug must NEVER fabricate a positive).
