# Fires once at every session start inside a Linear-configured
# worktree. Triggers one auto-sync round so a fresh session in
# a worktree (e.g. one cut minutes ago by `worktree-auto-cut.sh`
# or manually via `git worktree add`) is reflected in Linear
# immediately, without waiting for the first Edit|Write.
#
# The auto-sync is owner-gated inside tools/linear_sync.py::
# auto_sync — non-owners bail silently so contributors never
# leak their work into the owner's Linear workspace.

#   WORKTREE_DETECT=worktree → fire (sync into the worktree's handoff).

#                              worktree-create hook covers the cut case,
#                              and the Edit|Write hook covers in-place work).
#   WORKTREE_DETECT=outside  → silent (not a git working tree).
