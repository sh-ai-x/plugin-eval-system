# log-on-session-start.sh — SessionStart hook.
#
# Auto-installs dev-kit loghooks (Stop + SessionEnd transcripts) at
# every session start. log-on is idempotent (entry merge is sentinel-
# keyed on the command string), so this never duplicates. Without
# this hook, every new `git worktree add` cuts a session that is
# invisible to /dev-kit:token-analyzer until the developer remembers
# to run `/dev-kit:log on` by hand.
#
# Discriminator (worktree-detect.sh):
#   WORKTREE_DETECT=worktree → fire (auto-copy tools/save_log.py from
#                                main checkout if missing, then log-on).
#   WORKTREE_DETECT=main     → fire IFF dev-kit is installed locally
#                              (`tools/save_log.py` in cwd) OR globally
#                              (`~/.claude/save_log.py` exists). Without
#                              either, stay silent — refuse to fabricate
#                              a setup we don't own.
#   WORKTREE_DETECT=outside  → silent (not a git working tree).
#   WORKTREE_DETECT=""       → silent (jq missing — fails open, no-op).
#
# Why main now fires: a fresh `dev-kit:bootstrap` project leaves the
# per-project loghook uninstalled until the developer runs /dev-kit:log
# on by hand. That gap is silent data loss — every main checkout session
# between bootstrap and the first manual on goes un-captured. Firing
# here closes the gap with zero manual ritual.
#
# Fails open (exit 0 with stderr warning) when `jq` is missing or
# when log-on.sh itself errors out — same policy as
# session-start-check.sh.
