# sub-agent-handoff.sh — PostToolUse Agent hook. SHO-154.
#
# Advisory check that the sub-agent response shape can support the
# standard handoff template:
#
#   1. STATUS marker     — `**Status**:` line + ✅/⚠️/❌ (or
#                          success/partial/failed)
#   2. EVIDENCE block    — at least one quoted `exit N` reference
#                          (canonical: `cmd -> result (exit N)`;
#                          accepted: any `(exit N)`, `exit N` in
#                          prose, `Ran 'cmd': result` form)
#   3. NEXT-ACTION line  — `### Next action` heading, a list-item
#                          prefix, OR a final imperative sentence
#                          (KO + EN forms).
#
# If any of those three are absent, the hook emits an advisory to
# stderr listing which pieces the orchestrator should add before
# relaying the result to the user. Always exit 0 (advisory). Per
# #539 ("Linear failures are non-blocking for implicit workflow
# calls"), payload parse errors are also non-blocking so unrelated
# sessions cannot hit a soft-bricked hook.
#
# Fail-CLOSED only when jq OR python3 is missing (exit 2 with a
# plain stderr ERROR) — without these, the payload cannot be
# parsed/scanned and the rule silently lapses. NOTE: PostToolUse
# cannot actually block (the tool has already executed by the time
# we run), so the exit code is a *signal* to the harness and the
# stderr line is what surfaces to the user. We deliberately do NOT
# emit a `permissionDecision: "deny"` JSON envelope here — that
# field is decorative in PostToolUse and misleads readers about
# the actual contract. PreToolUse hooks in this repo use the
# `permissionDecision` envelope; PostToolUse hooks (slop-detector,
# secret-scan) emit plain stderr text. We follow the latter pattern.
#
# Per-worktree opt-out: write `<repo>/.dev-kit/.sub-agent-handoff-disabled`.
# The hook prints a one-shot notice and exits 0; structurally the
# hook pretends the response is complete so no advisory surfaces.
