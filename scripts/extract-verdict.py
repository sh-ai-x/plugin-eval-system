extract-verdict.py — extract the LLM review/security verdict from
anthropics/claude-code-action@v1's output file, with a PR-comments
fallback for providers that drop the assistant stream.

ROOT-CAUSE FIX (issue #244, boilerplate-web PR #17/#19): the previous
post-script extracted the verdict by grepping PR comments for
"Verdict: <value>". That works ONLY when the agent actually posts a
comment with a "Verdict:" line. When the agent posts an inline comment
(mcp__github_inline_comment) or no comment at all, the post-script
falls back to a stale comment from a previous run, causing the
severity gate to flip-flop between Approve / Changes Requested /
Blocked on every push.

This script reads the agent's full output (saved by the action to
$RUNNER_TEMP/claude-execution-output.json or
/home/runner/work/_temp/claude-execution-output.json) and extracts the
LAST assistant text that contains "Verdict: <value>". The action's
output is a JSON-lines stream of messages (init, user, assistant,
result, etc.). The assistant messages contain the model's text output;
the verdict appears in the FINAL assistant message per the prompt
contract.

ISSUE #625 — MINIMAX PROVIDER FALLBACK
The MINIMAX provider (CI_REVIEW_PROVIDER=minimax, via
https://api.minimax.io/anthropic) drops the assistant-message stream
from `claude-execution-output.json` — the file is parseable JSONL but
contains only `type: "preset"`, `type: "system"` init, and
`type: "result"` summary messages. The agent DOES post the verdict as
a PR comment body, but `extract()` returns PARSE_FAILED because there
is no assistant text block.

This script accepts an optional SECOND argument — a path to a JSON file
containing the PR comments for the current run (already filtered by
the caller to ONLY include comments whose body contains the current
`run=<GITHUB_RUN_ID>`). If the execution-file extraction returns
empty OR PARSE_FAILED, the script falls back to scanning those
comments for `Verdict: <value>`. The run-id filter is what defeats
the #244 stale-comment flap: by construction only comments posted in
THIS run are candidates.

CONTRACT (issue #612, consumer PR silent-Approve bug):
  - file missing / HTML / unreadable / suspiciously small → stdout=""
    (caller treats as the genuine "no-file" path; tolerance is
    appropriate because it usually means a transient filesystem /
    network problem)
  - file exists, parseable JSON, but no assistant message contains a
    recognizable `Verdict:` line → stdout="PARSE_FAILED"
    (the agent ran and produced JSON output, but did not emit the
    verdict contract — caller hard-fails the gate so the user MUST
    fix the prompt contract instead of silently letting Approve pass;
    see review.yml gate's `PARSE_FAILED` branch for the remediation
    message)
  - file exists, parseable JSON, with `Verdict:` in an assistant
    message → stdout=verdict (last one wins)
  - NEW (issue #625): if the file verdict is empty OR PARSE_FAILED
    AND a PR-comments file is provided as the second argument, fall
    back to scanning those comments for the verdict. The PR-comments
    file must be filtered by run_id by the caller (otherwise the
    #244 stale-comment flap returns).

The "PARSE_FAILED" sentinel is what enables the gate to distinguish
"agent ran but didn't follow the verdict contract" from "agent's output
file is genuinely missing" — the two failure modes deserve different
treatment (hard-fail vs. tolerance).

Robustness:
- If the file is missing, exits 0 with no output (caller falls back).
- If the file is HTML (e.g. 404 from a redirect), exits 0 with no
  output (caller falls back). Detected by checking the first non-blank
  character.
- If the file is parseable JSON but no Verdict, exits 0 with the
  PARSE_FAILED sentinel (caller hard-fails the gate — see CONTRACT
  above; this is the fix for the consumer silent-Approve bug).
- If the file is unreadable, exits 0 with no output (caller falls back).
- If a PR-comments file is provided and the file verdict is empty /
  PARSE_FAILED, scan those comments for the LAST `Verdict:` line.
  Caller is responsible for filtering by run_id (#244 defeat).
- Returns exit 0 (not 1) on "not found" or "parse failed" so the
  bash || true at the call site can stay simple.

Usage:
  python3 extract-verdict.py <path-to-claude-execution-output.json>
                             [<path-to-pr-comments-this-run.json>]

Prints the verdict (Approve|Blocked|Changes Requested), the sentinel
`PARSE_FAILED`, or nothing (empty stdout = caller falls back to no-file
path). Exits 0 always.
