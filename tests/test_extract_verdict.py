"""Tests for templates/ci/scripts/extract-verdict.py.

Verifies the verdict extraction contract that review.yml + security
post-steps rely on (issue #244, boilerplate-web PR #19 verification;
issue #612, consumer silent-Approve bug; issue #625, MINIMAX provider
drops assistant stream):

  1. Missing file     → exit 0, empty stdout
  2. HTML file        → exit 0, empty stdout (network error page)
  3. JSONL no verdict → exit 0, prints "PARSE_FAILED" (issue #612)
  4. JSONL one Approve verdict → exit 0, prints "Approve"
  5. JSONL two verdicts (last wins) → exit 0, prints last verdict
  6. Bad usage        → exit 2 (missing arg)

Issue #612 contract: distinguish "I couldn't read the file"
(missing / HTML / unreadable / suspiciously small → stdout="") from
"the file existed but had no recognizable `Verdict:` line"
(stout="PARSE_FAILED"). The latter is hard-failed by the severity
gate so a real review failure can't be papered over as Approve.

Issue #625 contract: when the execution-file verdict is empty OR
PARSE_FAILED AND a PR-comments file is provided as the second arg,
fall back to scanning that file for `Verdict: <value>` lines. The
caller is responsible for filtering by run_id (defeats #244 stale-
comment flap). The file verdict still wins when present.
